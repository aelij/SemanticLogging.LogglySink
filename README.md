SemanticLogging.LogglySink
==========================
Sink extension to the Enterprise Library Semantic Logging Application Block. Adding support for the log data management tool Loggly, www.loggly.com.

Read Microsofts documentation on Semantic Logging block here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn774980.aspx

Much of the code is based on the documentation and examples found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn775003(v=pandp.20).aspx
Especially I reused the code for making the sink asynchronously and buffered.
